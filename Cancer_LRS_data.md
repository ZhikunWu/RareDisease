## Long-read sequencing of an advanced cancer cohort resolves rearrangements, unravels haplotypes, and reveals methylation landscapes

[EGA data](https://ega-archive.org/studies/EGAS00001001159?page=0%2C2)

Genomic and transcriptomic sequence datasets for long-read and short-read platforms have been deposited at the European Genome-Phenome Archive (EGA; https://ega-archive.org/) as part of study EGA: EGAS00001001159, as listed in the key resources table, with accession numbers as listed in Table S1. Processed methylation frequency data are available from GEO under accession no. GEO: GSE270257. Other processed data from Long-Read POG, figure source data, and accompanying short-read variants can be downloaded from https://www.bcgsc.ca/downloads/nanopore_pog/. Data on mutations, copy changes, and expression from tumor samples in the POG program are also accessible from https://www.personalizedoncogenomics.org/cbioportal/. WGBS data, ENCODE accessions, and samples from GEO: GSE186458 that were used as normal tissues are listed in the key resources table and included in Table S8.
Code used to generate figures in this article is available in containerized, reproducible form at https://github.com/bcgsc/long_read_pog (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13180584).

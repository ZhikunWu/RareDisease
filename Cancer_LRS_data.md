[EGA data](https://ega-archive.org/studies/EGAS00001001159?page=0%2C2)

Genomic and transcriptomic sequence datasets for long-read and short-read platforms have been deposited at the European Genome-Phenome Archive (EGA; https://ega-archive.org/) as part of study EGA: EGAS00001001159, as listed in the key resources table, with accession numbers as listed in Table S1. Processed methylation frequency data are available from GEO under accession no. GEO: GSE270257. Other processed data from Long-Read POG, figure source data, and accompanying short-read variants can be downloaded from https://www.bcgsc.ca/downloads/nanopore_pog/. Data on mutations, copy changes, and expression from tumor samples in the POG program are also accessible from https://www.personalizedoncogenomics.org/cbioportal/. WGBS data, ENCODE accessions, and samples from GEO: GSE186458 that were used as normal tissues are listed in the key resources table and included in Table S8.
Code used to generate figures in this article is available in containerized, reproducible form at https://github.com/bcgsc/long_read_pog (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13180584).

## Long-read sequencing of an advanced cancer cohort resolves rearrangements, unravels haplotypes, and reveals methylation landscapes

The Long-Read POG cohort

Nanopore sequencing reveals novel complex SVs

Oncoviral integrations detected by long reads impact surrounding gene expression

Long-range phasing enables resolution of double hits to tumor suppressors

Long-range variant phasing facilitates the detection of ASE and linkage to genomic events

DNA methylation derived from nanopore sequencing can reveal global methylation patterns and reflect tissue of origin

Patterns of allele-specific methylation in promoters and gene bodies are uncovered by long-range phasing

Epigenetic inactivation of DNA repair genes

Genomic and epigenomic architecture of extrachromosomal DNA



## Gastric cancer genomics study using reference human pangenomes

Construction of GGCPan

GGCPan has advantages in the detection of structural variants

Read alignment rate comparison using three reference genomes

The completeness of graph pangenome does affect the performance of variant detection

There was little difference in the effect of different reference genomes on the detection of small variants, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and microsatellite instability (MSI)

A more comprehensive set of candidate driver genes was detected using the two pangenomes compared with GRCh38

Comparison of candidate driver genes with gene PAV analysis results

Comparison with two gastric cancer cohorts

Comparison of structural variant identification results using GGCPan and Minigraph-Cactus pangenome suggests the huge impact of reference graph pangenome

Time and memory used with three reference genomes

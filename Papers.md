A CNV is defined as high-confidence by GATK-gCNV (see Babadi et al.12 for details) if the following criteria are met:
(1)	The CNV is present in a high-quality sample (with ≤200 autosomal raw CNV calls of which at least 35 have QS >20).
(2)	The sample frequency of the call is ≤0.01 within the Broad callset.
(3)	The number of overlapped exons is ≥3.
(4)	The QS is equal or greater than the QS threshold as defined in Babadi et al.12 (QS >50 for duplications, >100 for deletions, and >400 for homozygous deletions).

## Whole-Exome Sequencing Among School-Aged Children With High Myopia

Cohort Information

Variational Spectrums Revealed for Known HM-Related Genes

Variant Yield by Severity of Myopia


Variant Interpretation

Variants were prefiltered so that only those passing the GATK VQSR (variant quality score recalibration) metric and those located outside of low-complexity regions remained. Low-certainty variant positions with a genotype depth (DP) less than 10 and genotype quality (GQ) less than 20 and heterozygous genotype calls with an allele balance of more than 0.8 or less than 0.2 were ignored. The annotation of variants was performed with Ensembl’s Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) version 99 for human genome assembly GRCh37.69We used the VEP70 CADD, LOFTEE,71 and SpliceAI plugins to generate additional bioinformatic estimations of variant deleteriousness. Potentially pathogenic protein-truncating variants (PTVs) were classified as frameshift variant, splice acceptor variant, splice donor variant, stop gained, or start lost variants. Variant filtering included the following steps: (1) the present analysis focuses on rare variants with presumed large effect sizes. Therefore, we excluded variants that had minor allele frequencies (MAF) higher than 0.005 from 3 external exome sequence databases (1000 Genomes; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Exome Sequencing Project; and gnomAD) and our MAGIC cohort. (2) We excluded variants not consistent with hereditary patterns, which were only 1-hit heterozygous variants in autosomal recessive (AR) genes and homozygous variants in autosomal dominant (AD) genes. Annotation of pathogenic (P), likely pathogenic (LP), variants of uncertain significance (VUS), benign (B), and likely benign (LB) for potentially pathogenic PTVs were performed by using ANNOtate VARiation software version 2020June,72 and pathogenicity was assigned according to 2015 American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) criteria using InterVar,73 which is a computational implementation of expert panel recommendations for clinical interpretation of genetic variants (ACMG 2015 criteria).74 A total of 75 genes were included in this study (eTable 2 in Supplement 2), including 16 nonsyndromic HM genes, 27 genes of eye syndromes associated with HM, and 32 genes of systemic syndromes associated withHM(hereafter, we refer to this gene list as HMgenes). All HMgenes were extracted from OMIM,75 IMI-Myopia Genetics Report,76 and PubMed for articles published up to December 2022 using genetic relevant keywords (for example, gene, genetic, mutation, or variant) and “high myopia.” Variants from 75 genes were selected from the WES data set of the school-aged population with HM.

## Satellite DNA in Vicia faba is characterized by remarkable diversity in its sequence composition, association with centromeres, and replication timing

Large number and sequence diversity of satellite repeats in V. faba

Satellites with large monomers are predominantly located in pericentric regions

Centromeric repeat composition differs between V. faba chromosomes

Three satellites display supernumerary FISH signals or signal size polymorphisms between homologous chromosomes

Satellite repeats vary as to their replication time during S phase
